                        A multiplayer horror game built in Unity. I designed and implemented core gameplay systems,

                        stability, and clear player feedback.

                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Built a Steam lobby flow (create/join via 5-digit code + invites), then used lobby state to coordinate
                                match start and scene transition into gameplay.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Wired the lobby host as the network host (Facepunch/Steam transport), and started Host/Client cleanly with
                                safety checks + fallbacks to avoid “double start” or invalid states.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implemented a player initialization pipeline (SteamID + name sync, “ready” gating, and spawn handling) so
                                clients don’t spawn until core managers and network state are valid.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Handled asymmetric roles by spawning the monster server-side and transferring ownership to a randomly selected
                                client, while enabling/disabling the correct local components per owner.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Synced movement/animation reliably using client-authoritative transforms where appropriate and networked animator
                                state updates, with despawn/death safety checks to prevent null spam during disconnects.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Integrated Vivox positional voice chat and tied channel lifecycle directly to the multiplayer lobby
                                (join/leave synchronized with match state).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Registered players into the voice system using Steam identity, dynamically attaching voice taps
                                and audio sources to spawned networked player objects.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implemented true proximity-based audio by combining Vivox 3D positioning with custom AudioSource
                                rolloff curves to control volume falloff and max speaking distance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Kept voice state stable across joins, leaves, deaths, and scene transitions by explicitly updating
                                player 3D positions each frame and re-binding ownership as needed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Built player-facing voice controls (mute self, mute others, per-player volume sliders, input device
                                selection) with settings persistence across sessions.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Built a physics-driven first-person controller (walk/sprint/crouch/jump) with stamina
                                and state-driven animation hooks for readable player feedback.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implemented slope-aware movement (surface-normal projection, velocity clamping, gravity handling)
                                to keep movement stable across uneven geometry.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Designed modular interactions using an <code>Interactables</code> interface and a player <code>Interactor</code>
                                so gameplay objects remain decoupled and easy to extend.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Built an inspection mechanic that moves objects into a camera-space view, supports rotate/zoom,
                                and safely disables/re-enables player + camera input while inspecting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Added environmental readability systems (spotlight detection + smooth fade/flicker) to support stealth
                                and communicate visibility to players.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Designed a player-centric lighting system that enables and disables spotlights dynamically
                                based on proximity, significantly reducing active light count during gameplay.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Avoided per-frame lighting cost by fully disabling lights outside the player’s influence
                                instead of leaving them active at zero intensity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implemented smooth fade-in/out with coroutine state tracking to prevent overlapping transitions
                                and visual popping when entering or exiting lit areas.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Added subtle, low-cost flicker to active lights to preserve horror atmosphere without
                                impacting performance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Used lighting as gameplay feedback to communicate visibility and danger to players,
                                improving stealth readability in dark environments.

                                A working end-to-end multiplayer flow: lobby creation, joining, role assignment,
