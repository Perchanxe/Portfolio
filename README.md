# Instructions after cloning repository
Open the terminal in the root folder (**`C:\Users\{name}\...\mjs-website`**) 

2. **`npm install`** → installs Vite, Tailwind, and any other dependencies in `package.json`.  
2. **`npm run dev`** → runs Vite dev server with Tailwind “watch” mode automatically.  
3. **`npm run build`** → compiles final optimized CSS/JS for deployment.

# Using Tailwind CSS
To use Tailwind CSS classes, you can directly call CSS styles in the html file. For example.

Instead of writing custom CSS like this:

```html
<style>
  .title {
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<h1 class="title">Moths are JELLY</h1>
```

You can use Tailwind classes directly in the HTML:

```
<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500">Moths are JELLY</h1>
```
See https://tailwindcss.com/docs for tailwind classes syntax.
